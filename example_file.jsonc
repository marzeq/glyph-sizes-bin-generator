        These positions are the local pixels in your glyph font sheets, such that 0 is the left-most pixel of the character's tile and 15 is the right-most.
        If both the starting and ending positions are the same number, the width will be 1 EXCEPT if the positions are 0, in which case the width will be 0 and the character will not display.
        Thus if you have a 1-pixel-wide character, it cannot be in the left-most position of its tile.
